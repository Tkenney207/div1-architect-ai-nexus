- Moved Master1 icon components from `src/components/ModuleIcons.tsx` to archived
- Removed Division1 and Master1 route links from the main navigation
- Updated Index page to focus on Engage module as the primary solution

### Archived Files

#### Pages
- `Division1Page.tsx` - Complete Division1 page component (archived as `src/archived/Division1Page.tsx`)
- `Master1Page.tsx` - Complete Master1 page component (archived as `src/archived/Master1Page.tsx`)

#### Components  
- `CharterToDivision1.tsx` - Component for generating Division1 from project charters (referenced but not found)
- `GuidedDivision1.tsx` - Guided Division1 creation workflow (referenced but not found)
- `Division1Review.tsx` - Review and enhancement functionality (referenced but not found)
- `Division1Generator.tsx` - Main Division1 generation component (referenced but not found)
- `ModuleIcons-archived.tsx` - Master1 and Division1 icons and logos

#### Hooks & Types
- `useDivision1Generator.ts` - Hook for Division1 generation logic (referenced but not found)
- `useSpecificationProcessor.ts` - Hook for specification file processing (preserved in main, archived version exists)
- All CSI types are preserved in `src/types/csi.ts`

## Restoration Steps

### 1. Restore Pages
```bash
# Move archived pages back to pages directory
mv src/archived/Division1Page.tsx src/pages/Division1.tsx
mv src/archived/Master1Page.tsx src/pages/Master1.tsx
```

### 2. Restore Components
```bash
# Create division1 directory if needed and restore any existing components
mkdir -p src/components/division1
# Note: Individual division1 components were referenced but not found in codebase
```

### 3. Restore Icons to Main ModuleIcons
```bash
# Copy Master1Logo, Master1Icon exports from ModuleIcons-archived.tsx
# Add them back to the main ModuleIcons.tsx file
```

### 4. Update App.tsx Routes
Add these routes back to src/App.tsx:
```typescript
import Division1 from "./pages/Division1";
import Master1 from "./pages/Master1";

// Add routes:
<Route path="/division1" element={<Division1 />} />
<Route path="/master1" element={<Master1 />} />
```

### 5. Restore Index.tsx Content
Restore the three-module layout in `src/pages/Index.tsx`:
- Add Division1 module card back to the solutions section
- Add Master1 module card back to the solutions section  
- Update hero text to mention "Three powerful solutions"
- Restore the grid layout for the three modules

### 6. Update Navigation
Add Division1 and Master1 back to any navigation components or menus where they were previously referenced.

## Preserved Functionality

### Complete Text & Copy Preserved
All marketing copy, descriptions, and user-facing text for Division1 and Master1 are preserved in:
- `src/archived/Division1Page.tsx` - All Division1 messaging and content
- `src/archived/Master1Page.tsx` - All Master1 messaging and content
- Previous version of `src/pages/Index.tsx` in version history

### Technical Implementation Preserved
- All TypeScript interfaces and types in `src/types/csi.ts`
- Complete specification processing logic in `src/hooks/useSpecificationProcessor.ts`
- Document analysis functionality preserved
- File upload and processing workflows preserved

### Design Assets Preserved
- All Master1 icons and logos in `src/archived/ModuleIcons-archived.tsx`
- Complete styling and visual design preserved in archived pages
- Color schemes and branding elements documented

## Notes
- All functionality was preserved exactly as it was when archived
- No breaking changes were made to the remaining codebase structure
- The platform now focuses on Engage as the primary solution
- All archived components can be restored without modification
- Database schemas and backend integrations remain unchanged

## Testing After Restoration
1. Verify all routes work correctly
2. Test Division1 generation functionality (if components exist)
3. Test Master1 specification synthesis
4. Verify all icons and components render properly
5. Check that all TypeScript types are properly imported
6. Restore three-module layout on Index page
7. Test navigation flows between modules
